//The Traveless App is designed to help users search flights, make reservations, and manage existing reservations. Users can input origin, destination, and day to find available flights. The users can then select a flight to reserve after inputting their name and citizenship. The system generates a unique reservation code and saves details once a reservation is made. Users can search for their existing reservation details by inputting either their reservation code, airline, or name. This application uses SQLite database and local data files to store data.
